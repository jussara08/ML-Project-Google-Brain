Medical tests research.


MaxHR: 

* The maximum heart rate achieved, this test is usually done involving a monitored and graded exercise test (treadmill or bicycle) 
 and can cost from 100$ to 300$ in the US.


Exercise Angina:

* An Exercise Angina test, commonly known as an exercise stress test or treadmill test, evaluates how well the heart 
 handles stress by monitoring its electrical activity and blood pressure while the patient walks on a treadmill or rides 
 a stationary bike. The test is designed to bring on symptoms of angina in a controlled setting to diagnose coronary artery disease.

* The test stops when you reach your target heart rate, are too tired, or if you develop significant symptoms like chest pain, 
 abnormal heart rhythm, or concerning blood pressure changes.

* Can cost from 175$ to 5 000$ in the US, depends on:

    * Standard exercise test (175$ to 400$);
    * Stress Echocardiogram (1 000$ to 3 500$);
    * Nuclear Stress Test (600$ to 5 000$).


OldPeak:

* An "Oldpeak" test is not a standalone diagnostic procedure, but rather a key measurement derived from an 
 Exercise Treadmill Test (ETT), also known as a Stress Test. Oldpeak refers specifically to the amount of ST 
 segment depression (a marker on an electrocardiogram) induced by exercise, comparing it to the level at rest.
 A higher numerical value for oldpeak suggests a greater risk of heart disease, specifically myocardial ischemia, 
 as it indicates a reduced blood supply to the heart during exertion.

* Can cost from 25 000$ to 60 000$ in the US.

ST Slope:

* The test is performed in a clinical setting using a treadmill or bicycle ergometer, 
 often adhering to the Bruce protocol (gradual increases in speed and gradient).

* The patient exercises until they reach maximum effort, exhaustion, develop symptoms (e.g., chest pain),
  or reach a target heart rate.

* Typical price range in US: 200$ to 1 500$.



* Resting Blood Pressure (RestingBP)
  Purpose
 Screens for hypertension (high blood pressure)
 Assesses risk of:
 Heart attack
 Stroke
 Kidney disease
 Often first indicator of cardiovascular stress
*  How It’s Done
 Inflatable cuff placed on upper arm
 Measures systolic & diastolic pressure
 Takes 1–2 minutes
 No preparation needed
 Cost in  (USD)
Setting	Cost
Public healthcare (with prescription)	$0–$10
Private clinic	$10–$25
Usually included in a doctor visit.

* Cholesterol Test (Lipid Panel)
  Purpose
Measures total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides
Evaluates risk of:
Coronary artery disease
Heart attack
Stroke
Used for preventive screening
   How It’s Done
Blood drawn from vein
Sometimes requires 8–12 hour fasting
Lab analyzes lipid levels
* Cost in  (USD)
Setting	Cost
Public system (prescribed)	$0–$25
Private lab	$25–$90
Often part of a routine health panel.

* Fasting Blood Sugar (FastingBS)
* Purpose
Screens for diabetes or prediabetes
Detects abnormal glucose metabolism
Important for cardiovascular risk modeling
* How It’s Done
8–12 hour fast required
Blood sample taken
Lab measures glucose level
 Cost in USD
Setting	Cost
Public system	$0–$25
Private lab	$20–$70
Often bundled with metabolic panel.
 
* Resting ECG (Electrocardiogram / EKG)
 Purpose
Detects:
Arrhythmias
Heart ischemia
Previous heart attack
Electrical abnormalities
Used in ER for chest pain evaluation
  * How It’s Done
Electrodes placed on chest, arms, legs
Patient lies still for 5–10 minutes
Heart’s electrical activity recorded
 Cost in  (USD)
Setting	Cost
Public system	$0–$45
Private clinic	$45–$130
 Total Typical Cardiac Workup Cost in  (USD)
Public system (with referral):
 $0 – $60 total out-of-pocket
Private clinic:
 $100 – $250 total
